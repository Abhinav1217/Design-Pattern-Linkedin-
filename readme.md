_Note: I am not using exercise files because I am on linux and exercise files are based on Windows compiler. My files are different and adjusted for gcc setup on my system. Don't trust my code to work on any other machine. Also, this was a 24 hr free course offer during lockdown. exercise files was not included for free_
